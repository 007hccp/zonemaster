# Zonemaster installation guide

This document provides links on how to install the different components of the
Zonemaster software. The software has not yet been packaged for any operating
systems, and you have to install most of it from the source code.

There is installation support available for all the four components of the
Zonemaster software for the following operating systems:

 * Ubuntu 
 * Debian Wheezy 
 * FreeBSD 
 * CentOS 


## Components

The Zonemaster software contains four different components. The
most important component is the Zonemaster Engine, which is the core
library that implements the DNS test framework and all the test cases.

In order to use the Zonemaster Engine you *must* install one of the
applications, the simplest being the CLI interface.

Another application is the web interface which is split in two
parts. The user visible component is the Web Frontend, and the backend
is responsible for the testing. The CLI and the web interface are both
dependent on the Zonemaster Engine.
