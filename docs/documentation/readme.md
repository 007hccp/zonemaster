# Documentation

The documentation is split in three parts:

 * [Installation](installation.md) - how to install on different platforms
 * [Using](using.md) the CLI and Web interface
 * [JSON-output](json-output.md) is the description of the JSON format

There is also a [FAQ](gui-faq-en.md) on the web interface available.
