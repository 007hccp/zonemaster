## CONFIGURATION03: Lame delegation 
different

### Test case identifier

**CONFIGURATION03:** Lame delegation

### Objective 

When a parent zone 'P' delegates part of its namespace to a child 'C', P stores
the list of NS records for the authoritative servers of zone 'C'. This list of
NS records are kept both at the parent 'P' and the child zone 'C'. 

Lame delegation occurs when changes at the 'C' are not reflected to the NS RRs
at 'P'. Lame delegation can also occur when the NS RRs are consistent at both
'P' and 'C', but both point to non-existing or non-authoritative servers. 

### Inputs

The domain to be tested.

### Ordered description of steps to be taken to execute the test case

1. Configure a live zone with lame delegation

```
For example ('P' Zone "nic.fr") : 

rd    IN  NS     ns1
rd    IN  NS     ns2
rd    IN  NS     ns3

In Zone 'C' ("rd.nic.fr"):

      IN  NS     ns1
      IN  NS     ns2

```
2. Obtain the complete set of name servers from the parent using
[Method2](../specifications/tests/Methods.md) and the child using [Method3]
(../specifications/tests/Methods.md).
3. Query for the SOA record.
4. If there is an answer with NOERROR and there is no content in the answer
section, this test case fails.

### Outcome(s)

The engine should return FAIL atleast once for the configuration defined. If it
returns PASS for all the tests then the engine does not capture Lame delegation.

### Special procedural requirements	

None
