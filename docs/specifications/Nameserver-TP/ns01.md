## NS01: A name server should not be a recursor

### Test case identifier
**NS01** A name server should not be a recursor

### Objective

To ensure consistency in DNS, an authoritative name server should not be
configured to do recursive lookups. Also, open recursive resolvers are
considered bad internet practice due to their capability of assisting in
large scale DDoS attacks.

### Inputs

The domain name to be tested.

### Ordered description of steps to be taken to execute the test case

1. Find all hostnames for all the name servers used by the domain.
   (This is all the name servers from the parent delegation, and all the
   name servers in the apex of the zone itself.)
2. A SOA query for an almost certainly nonexistent name sent to the each
   name server found in step 1, with the flag Recursion Desired (RD) set.
3. If any answer of the queries made in step 2 contains an RCODE other than
   SERVFAIL or REFUSED and referring to another server, this test case is
   failed.

### Outcome(s)

If the response is a possible referral this test case fails.

### Special procedural requirements

None.

### Intercase dependencies

None.
