## NS04: Same source address

### Test case identifier
**NS04** Same source address

### Objective

Responses from the authoritative name servers must contain same source IP
address as the destination IP address of the initial query. This has been
clarified in section 4 of
[RFC 2181](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2181#section-4).

### Inputs

The domain name to be tested.

### Ordered description of steps to be taken to execute the test case

1. Obtain the list of name servers for the domain using [Method 2]
   (../Methods.mduser-content-method-2--obtain-the-name-servers-authoritative-for-the-domain-from-its-parent) and [Method 3]
   (../Methods.mduser-content-method-3--obtain-the-name-servers-authoritative-for-the-domain-from-the-child-zone).

2. A SOA query for the domain name sent to the each name server found in
   step 1, with the recursion request and DNSSEC flags set.
3. Any answer received from the SOA query must come from the same source IP address
   as the query was sent to. If there is a mismatch, this test case fails.

### Outcome(s)

If the response is a possible referral this test case fails.

### Special procedural requirements

None.

### Intercase dependencies

None.
