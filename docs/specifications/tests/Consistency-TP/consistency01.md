## CONSISTENCY01: Serial number must be consistent between authoritative name servers 

### Test case identifier

**CONSISTENCY01:** Serial number must be consistent between authoritative
name servers 

### Objective

For the data served by the authoritative name servers for a desginated zone
to be consistent, all authoritative name servers must serve the same SOA
record for the designated zone.   

If the serial number, which is part of the SOA record is not consistent
between authoritative servers, there is a possibility that the data served
is inconsistent. The reasons for this inconsistency may be different - such
as misconfiguration, or as a result of slow propagation to the secondary
name servers.

The objective of this test is to verify that the serial number is consistent
between different authoritative name servers.

### Inputs

1. The domain name to be tested

### Ordered description of steps to be taken to execute the test case
1. Obtain the list of name servers from [Method2](../Methods.md) and
[Method3](../Methods.md)
2. Apply [Method6](../Methods.md) to all the authoritative name servers for
the domain. 
3. If the SOA serial number is not the same from all the answers received
from step 2, then the test fails

### Outcome(s)

All authoritative name servers must have consistent serial numbers. If the
test does not find any inconsistency, then the test succeeds

### Special procedural requirements	

If for operational reasons, the zone content fluctuates rapidly (e.g. within
a second), then the test may fail even though there is no misconfigurations.
In this case, the serial numbers between different authoritative name
servers need only to be loosely coherent. A manual inspection of the SOA
serial should be enough to determine if the zone updates work properly or
not, and if the serial values are within a reasonable range, the test is OK. 

Such manual inspection is needed in the case of zones which rapidly
fluctuates, as in the case of Top Level Domains (TLDs).  

### Intercase dependencies

None
