## ADDRESS01: Name server address must not be in private network

### Test case identifier
**ADDRESS01** A name server address must be in the globally routable public
 address space.

### Objective

In order for the domain and its resources to be accessible, authoritative 
name servers must have addrresses in the routable public addressing space.

[RFC 1918](https://tools.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1918.txt) defines the private IPv4
address space and [RFC 6598](https://tools.ietf.org/rfc/rfc6598.txt) the IPv4
shared address space. 

[RFC 3330](https://tools.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3330.txt) and [RFC 5735]
(https://tools.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5735.txt) specify reserved and multicast blocks
that should not appear on the public Internet.

Finally, [RFC 5156](https://tools.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5156.txt) gives a compilation
of reserved and special use of IPv6 blocks that are invalid routing prefixes.

### Inputs

The domain name to be tested.

### Ordered description of steps to be taken to execute the test case

1. Obtain the IP addresses of each name server of the domain checked using
   [Method5](../Methods.md)

2. Each IP address has to be checked against the following blocks :
 

|Address Block                        | Description               | Reference |
|:------------------------------------|:--------------------------|:----------|

  ::ffff:0:0/96                                                               
  fe80::/10, fc00::/7                 |                           |           |
| 2001:db8::/32                       |                           |           |
| 5f00::/8, 3ffe::/16                 |                           |           |
| 2001:10::/28                        |                           |           |
| ::/0                                |                           |           |
| ff00::/8                            |                           |           |

| ::<ipv4-address>/96                 | Deprecated                | RFC 5156  |

3. If any address matches one of the private blocks, the test case
   fails.

### Outcome(s)

If one name server address is part of a private network, the test fails.
If all the name server addresses are in the public addressing space, the
test succeeds.

### Special procedural requirements

None.

### Intercase dependencies

None.
