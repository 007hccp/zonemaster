## DELEGATION04: Test whether referral response at the authoritative section fit into a 512 byte UDP packet

### Test case identifier
**DELEGATION04:** Test whether referral response at the authoritative section fit into a 512 byte UDP packet

### Objective
The Domain Name System defaults to using UDP for queries and replies with a DNS payload limit of 512 bytes.  Larger replies cause an initial truncation indication leading to a subsequent handling via TCP with substantially higher overhead.  EDNS0 is used to permits larger UDP responses thus reducing the need for use of TCP.

But [IANA](https://www.iana.org/help/nameserver-requirements) still maintains that referrals from the parent zonne name servers must fit into a non-EDNS0 UDP DNS packet. Hence this test is done. 

In this test, the authoritaitve section of the referral response from the child domain must fit into a 512 byte UDP packet.

### Inputs
1. The label of the domain name to be tested

### Ordered description of steps to be taken to execute the test case
1. An empty DNS answer packet is generated. 
2. All the data from the input is added to the packet. 
3. If the size of the packet is more than 512 bytes, then the test fails

### Outcome(s)
If the created packet fits into 512 byte UDP packet, then the test succeeds

### Special procedural requirements
None

### Intercase dependencies
None
