## ADDR01: Nameserver address must not be in private network

### Test case identifier
**ADDR01** A name server address must not be in private network

### Objective

In order for the domain and its resources to be accessible, authoritative 
name servers must have addrresses in the public addressing space.

In section 3. of RFC 1918 (https://tools.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1918.txt), the
private address space is defined.

### Inputs

The domain name to be tested.

### Ordered description of steps to be taken to execute the test case

1. Find all hostnames for all the name servers used by the domain 
   by sending NS requests to the parent zone and the zone itself name
   servers.

2. Find all IPv4 addresses for each name server. 
   For in-bailwick name servers, addresses come from glue records. For 
   out-bailwick name servers, separate recursive A queries need to be sent.

3. Each address of each name server has to be checked against the three
   blocks allocated to private networks : 10/8, 172.16/12 and
   192.168/16.

3. If any address matches one of the private blocks, the test case
   fails.

### Outcome(s)

If one name server address is part of a private network, the test fails.
If all the name server addresses are in the public addressing space, the
test succeeds.

### Special procedural requirements

None.

### Intercase dependencies

None.
