Meeting FR-SE -  on 04/06/2013
===================================

*Participants*
Stephane Bortzmeyer, Sandoche Balakrichenan, Samia M'timet, Mohsen Souissi, Vincent Levigneron (Afnic)
Anne Marie, Patrik Wallstrom, Einar Lonn, Roger (IIS)

*Context*
After having done a couple of meetings with .SE regarding collaboration for the development of a new DNS checking tool, the objective of this meeting was to confirm the interest for the collaboration, identify the issues that have risen due to IIS work with ICANN (developing a tool for the pre-delegation check for the new gTLDs) and fix a kick off date for this project.
The meeting took place for an hour after the CENTR-tech meeting in Amsterdam. Some of the basic topics discussed were:

*Conflicts/Uses with respect to IIS work with ICANN*
<ul>
<li>For the new project there will be two important steps - 1. Specification 2. Development </li>
<li> Afnic - Will it be able for IIS to re-use the specifications or code from the work that they had done with ICANN ? </li>
<li>IIS - It will be possible to re-use some modules. Since they have accumulated a know-how with ICANN on writing specification for a similar project it will be easy to write the specification. Certain materials like Test list, Specification what should be the input, the output etc. could be re-used. </li>
<li>Afnic - In case of re-use of the code will there be any conflict with ICANN such as the type of license?</li>
<li>IIS - They have weekly meeting with ICANN. They will discusss the legal issues and then they will come back to Afnic with the feedback. But as of now they think it will not be an issue.</li>
</ul>

*Allocation of Resources*
<ul>
<li>Afnic - Would like to have a commitment, when it will be possible to bootstrap the project to allocate resources internally.</li>
<li>IIS - Major part of the work with ICANN is over and there will be more resources available for other activities by early September - October.</li>
</ul>

*Technical details*
<ul>
<li> Programming language will be PERL </li>
<li> The tool should be extensible </li>
<li> First version will have the basic components of everything needed and there will be a road map for other versions </li> 
<li> Benchmarking of .fr and .se zones should be done with the tool once the first version is ready
PPS will be used for project management </li>
<li> Collaborative environment like git could be used for the collaboration.</li> 
<li> Ideas from .rs about needing a tool which checks bulk domain names could be integrated for subsequent versions </li> 
<li> A discussion about using ECDSA took place, but its possibility will be looked at in the subsequent versions </li>
<li> Should look at pilots to test the first version. Also it was decided that we will eat our own dog food.</li> 
</ul> 

*Administravia*
<ul>
*From IIS*
<li> Patrik could be the technical lead for the project </li> 
<li> Einar will help in specifications and writing </li> 
<li> Calle (Name to be confirmed) will be the key person for the development </li> 
*From Afnic*
<li> Vincent Levigneron was introduced who will play an important role in this project from Afnic </li> 
<li> A technical lead recruitment is in process in Afnic who once recruited will also have an important involvement in the project </li> 
</ul> 

*Next Important steps*
<ul> 
<li> 1. AFNIC will send some specifications on what tests we think need to be integrated with the new tool </li> 
<li> 2. IIS will create a mailing list for the project </li>
