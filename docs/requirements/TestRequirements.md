Comment regarding addresses in bogon prefixes: DNSCheck implements checks against invalid addresses defined in RFCs. Since all of IPv4 space has been delegated to the RIRs, that is the whole of the low-volatility bogon space. The high-voltility bogon list would require daily (or even more frequent) updates, which is not practical in a standalone library.


Tests to implement from DNSCheck
--------------------------------

Although the list of [All DNSCheck Messages](https://github.com/dotse/dnscheck/wiki/Detailed-list-of-all-possible-dnscheck-messages)
is comprehensive, it is not a list of tests as such. It is a list of messages emitted by DNSCheck.

|Req| DNSCheck                                                             | DNSCheck | Level |

Future tests
------------
 * Case insensitivity in a name server, [RFC 4343](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4343).
 * More tests of EDNS(0), [RFC 6891](http://tools.ietf.org/search/rfc6891).
 * AXFR is complex, perhaps do more inspection of data coming from AXFR,
   [RFC 5936](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5936).
 * Check for algorithm completeness (DS->DNSKEY->RRSIG) as per section 2.2 of
   [RFC 4035](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4035#section-2.2).
 * domain of the hostmaster email is not an openrelay
 * can deliver email to 'postmaster'
 * can deliver email to hostmaster
 * domain able to receive email (delivery using MX, A, AAAA)
 * test if mail delivery possible
 * ICMP answer
 * Test for referral to root (possible DDoS vector for authoritative name servers)
 * Check to see if removed authoritative name server is still authoritative (requires
   a new input parameter, "previous ns")

Discarded tests
---------------
 * loopback delegation (Section 4.1 of RFC 1912)
 * loopback is resolvable (Section 4.1 of RFC 1912)

Requirements on writing test specifications
-------------------------------------------

These are some requirements for writing specifications for "Zonemaster":

 1. Follow the framework of the IEEE 829-2008.
 2. The documents must be in [Markdown Syntax]
    (http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax).
 3. Keep the columns in the document below 80, preferrably shorter than 74
    columns. (Much easier to see changes in documents using the tools
	available for diffing).
 4. Use [normative language]
   (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normative#Standards_documents).
 5. Refer to any reference that is the rationale for implementing the test
    case. If there are no reference to any standards, describe the reason
    for implementing the test. For most references, we use RFCs from IETF.
 6. Use well defined terms. Terms such as FQDN and FQHN seems to have dual
    meanings.
 7. The name of the test case might be better than the name of the
    requirements. Feel free to improve the name of the test case if it is
    possible to improve on the wording to make the test case clearer for
    the reader and the user of the software. Text from the test cases
    probably will be reused in other contexts.
 8. Be very clear in what DNS queries are performed, and what answers are
	expected. If a specific DNS protocol flag has to be set in the query,
	specify this as well. In general, be closer to describing the DNS
	protocol actions than to use more generic language.
 9. Use the same headers and titles as in all other test cases. Try
	to use the same style as used in the other tests.
 10. Make sure to write the tests so that any implementer that implements
    the tests will have the same outcome as any other implementation.
