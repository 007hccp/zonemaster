Comment regarding addresses in bogon prefixes: DNSCheck implements checks against invalid addresses defined in RFCs. Since all of IPv4 space has been delegated to the RIRs, that is the whole of the low-volatility bogon space. The high-voltility bogon list would require daily (or even more frequent) updates, which is not practical in a standalone library.


Tests to implement from DNSCheck
--------------------------------

Although the list of [All DNSCheck Messages](https://github.com/dotse/dnscheck/wiki/Detailed-list-of-all-possible-dnscheck-messages)
is comprehensive, it is not a list of tests as such. It is a list of messages emitted by DNSCheck.
