GUI - Functional Test requirements
======================================

Objective
----------
The objective of this document is to run functional tests for the Web GUI.

Scope
------
The scope of the testing will limited to the follows:
   * GUI testing : Test if the objects in the interface are displayed exactly
   how they are supposed to display
   * Functionality testing : Validation of actual functionality of controls
   after giving input to certain fields in the application
 
Security and Performance testing are not included.
