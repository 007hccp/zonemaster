### Background

DNSCheck from .SE and Zonecheck from AFNIC are two different software
packages that do DNS validation of the quality of a DNS
delegation. The Zonemaster implementation intends to be a major
rewrite of these software packages, and implement the best parts of
both.

### Purpose

DNSCheck from .SE and Zonecheck from AFNIC are two different software
packages that do DNS validation of the quality of a DNS delegation.

packages, and implement the best parts of both.

### Documentation

There is some [user documentation](docs/documentation/readme.md) available
on how to install and use the Zonemaster software.
