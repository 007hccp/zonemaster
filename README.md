### Background

DNSCheck from IIS and Zonecheck from AFNIC are two different software
packages that do DNS validation of the quality of a DNS
delegation. The Zonemaster implementation intends to be a major
rewrite of these software packages, and implement the best parts of
both.

### Purpose

DNSCheck from IIS and Zonecheck from AFNIC are two different software
packages that do DNS validation of the quality of a DNS delegation.
The Zonemaster implementation is a major rewrite of these software
packages, and implement the best parts of both.

### Documentation

The repository you are looking at is the main project repository. In this
repository documentation regarding the [design](docs/design),
[requirements](docs/requirements) and [specifications](docs/specifications)
for the zonemaster implementation are available.

Also, in this repository, you can find a brief [user guide](docs/using.md) and [installation guide](docs/installation.md) on how on how to install and use the Zonemaster software.
