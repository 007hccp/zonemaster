Zonemaster
==========

### Background

DNSCheck from .SE and Zonecheck from AFNIC are two different software
packages that do DNS validation of the quality of a DNS
delegation. The Zonemaster implementation intends to be a major
rewrite of these software packages, and implement the best parts of
both.

### Purpose

The purpose of Zonemaster is to test the quality of a DNS
delegation. The core of the software is all the implemented
tests. There will be a command line tool to run a complete set of
tests, and a web interface tailored for use by both basic and advanced
users.

### Documentation

There is some [user documentation](docs/documentation/readme.md) available
on how to install and use the Zonemaster software.

### Participation

The core development team are people from .SE and Afnic. However, you
can submit code by forking this repository and create pull requests.

You can follow the project in these two mailinglists:

 * [zonemaster-users](http://lists.iis.se/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/zonemaster-users)
 * [zonemaster-devel](http://lists.iis.se/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/zonemaster-devel)
